For many of us, we spent the year away from Morningside Heights, creating a Columbia community from the confines of our bedroom. However, a remote campus has not stopped the forces of social justice across the campus. Throughout the course of a global pandemic, we have seen a tuition strike rise and eventually fall, a student workers\u2019 strike that led to the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers\u2019 first proposed contract, though it was eventually rejected. The events of the 2020-21 school year will be moments that will define not only Columbia but also New York City and the United States for decades to come. \n\nAt Spectator, we have used our year of remote learning to show the inequities within the Morningside Heights and West Harlem communities and how Columbia\u2019s power as a major research institution has increased those gaps. As the University continues to engage with its students, faculty, administrators, and trustees and continues to expand its influence over members of the Morningside Heights and West Harlem communities, we will continue to hold those in power to account and investigate what goes on inside the offices in Low Library. \n\nWhile the University may appear to be an institution primarily focused on education, this year has demonstrated that a multi-billion dollar research university has far more stories to be told than just those in the classroom. This year, we focused on interrogating how Columbia interacts with its students and the larger community. We hope that through observing the events of the past year\u2014from how the COVID-19 vaccine was unevenly distributed between Morningside Heights and Harlem to the depleting local business scene on Broadway to how the University\u2019s athletic facilities negatively influence recruitment and performance\u2014you can look at Columbia a little bit differently than you did before.  \n\nWe invite you to take a look back on the stories this year that shaped a turning point in Columbia\u2019s history and will continue to influence the University\u2019s future.\n",Lt=d.c.div(xt(),function(t){return t.theme.black}),Mt=d.c.div(Bt(),function(t){return t.theme.black}),Ht=d.c.h2(Dt(),function(t){return

the confines of art have been broken down and tossed out the window. Could anyone have imagined that Columbia\u2019s dance groups would spend hours editing together footage of dancers scattered across the globe? That tickets to a Broadway show would become a virtual pass into a Zoom theater production? That chat boxes would replace clapping and shouting during concerts?\n\nArt is creative expression. Art is adaptability. Art is passion. Art is, I guess, a bunch of little Zoom squares.\n\nAlthough many students never stepped foot on campus last year, the arts blossomed. While some took a hiatus in preparation for the return to in-person instruction, most groups worked around the obvious challenge and created shows, concerts, exhibitions, and films from their laptops. While only a fraction of students lived on campus this year, arts groups worked through the isolation and came together to connect the Columbia community. Many students took this time to record albums, launch fashion brands, start video blogs, and create literary publications. Others transformed their living rooms into dance studios, bedrooms into art labs, and dorm kitchens into gourmet facilities. The arts are not dead, and they will never die.\n\nArts & Entertainment documented many of these stories and gave readers an opportunity to learn about and engage with the arts on and around campus. Writers have been hard at work profiling emerging artists and providing in-depth coverage of student-led productions. Beyond these local topics, Arts & Entertainment took this time to investigate and question systemic issues within the broader arts community, looking to shed light on problems that the pandemic and racial unrest exacerbated.\n\nThrough long-form stories, Arts & Entertainment examined gender inequity in the film industry, Columbia\u2019s role in the development of hip-hop, and the evolving Core Curriculum. Our writers highlighted stories of women, people of color, and LGBTQ people who have historically lacked a voice in the arts world. In addition, we covered issues of climate change, sexual harassment, and mental health in the arts, exploring how we as journalists and artists can push for equity.\n\nMoreover, Arts & Entertainment analyzed the University\u2019s relationship to the surrounding area by investigating issues such as food gentrification, income and resource disparity, and efforts to protect neighborhood culture. We expanded coverage into Harlem by exploring food insecurity, art and its role in preserving history, and fashion as an expression of identity. Through archival work, writers dug up secrets of the past that have had profound impacts on local communities, especially marginalized groups who have very rarely received media attention.\n\nSomeone had asked me at the beginning of the year how an arts section would even exist if there were no arts to cover. I told them that this was the best time to dig deeper and tell stories that revealed why the arts matter, especially when in-person performances halted. The arts ultimately became a means through which artists, from behind their laptops, could connect with each other and discover themselves.\n",author:"Noah Sheidlower",role:"Arts & Entertainment

Taking photos of a campus that was missing the majority of its student population presented numerous difficulties, and our work was complicated by only having a handful of photographers in New York City. Despite these challenges, we pioneered new methods of capturing photos, participating in everything from socially distanced portrait sessions to Zoom and FaceTime photoshoots. We completed photo essays, captured events everywhere from Times Square to West Harlem, took portraits of campus leaders and students, and worked to ensure Spectator\u2019s articles received suitable visual coverage. Here, you will find just a glimpse of our work, including our coverage of virtual theater performances, President Joe Biden\u2019s election, and the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers\u2019 strike.",Photo_Essays:{name:"Photo Essays",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WWRNGQBQJRAX3OWVS6TFX7NUDU.jpg",blurb:"",articles:[{title:"In Focus: My Digicam Life",author:"Gabi Levy",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essay/2021/04/09/in-focus-my-digicam-life/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/ZCDASOHNVFGVRKEHHJZ4I3B73Y.jpg"},{title:"Fear of Missing Out: A First-Year Experience",author:"Selina Yang",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/the-eye/2021/02/04/fear-of-missing-out-a-first-year-experience/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/KM62I5C2YRD2FIRVQWQL6J7TY4.jpg"},{title:"Through students' eyes: Voting in 2020",author:"Kate Della Pietra, Selina Yang, Princeton Huang, Joao Santos, Olivia Treynor, Beatrice Shlansky",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essay/2020/11/03/through-students-eyes-voting-in-2020/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/6PTMIZ7BXND55I2PTJVJGTCC7U.jpg"},{title:"When restaurants struggle to survive, what does it mean for the community?",author:"Millie Felder, Beatrice Shlansky",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essays/2021/01/21/when-restaurants-struggle-to-survive-what-does-it-mean-for-the-community/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/FI27W5OH2ZASZMRMGFAYVB5N4I.jpg"},{title:"Anticipation of a Biden presidency: Reactions in New York",author:"Temi Gorge, Rommel Nunez, Samantha Camacho, Jazilah Salam",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essay/2020/11/07/anticipation-of-a-biden-presidency-reactions-in-new-york/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/OEWBANT2H5AGHJ2SPSNK5ZV3ZQ.jpeg"},{title:"A walk through West Harlem: A look at often overlooked historic sites",author:"Beatrice Shlansky",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essay/2021/02/15/a-walk-through-west-harlem-a-look-at-often-overlooked-historic-sites/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/5JEX7WGSLZEWHO4PAK5RSD44XQ.jpg"},{title:"In focus: Columbia graduate students picket on the first day of strike",author:"Selina Yang, Joao Santos, Millie Felder, Samantha Camacho",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/photo-essay/2021/03/16/in-focus-columbia-graduate-students-picket-on-the-first-day-of-strike/",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/RX7ENP5ITVBWHO3LRMOJ7FS47U.jpg"}]},items:[{name:"News",articles:[{front_image:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/2GDOYBTXOVFBHO4TOM3Y2WYRXY.jpg",img:"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/2GDOYBTXOVFBHO4TOM3Y2WYRXY.jpg",description:"During the fall semester, there were 258 reports of alleged Health Compact violations.

While Columbia worked to increase COVID-19 safety on campus, many in the city found it difficult to access basic health resources in their own communities. There is a lack of access\u2014not necessarily just to resources, although that is also an issue. However, City News has also been looking into the effects of environmental racism in the area as well as the growing movement for climate justice taking place in New York City, and thus West Harlem, as well.
