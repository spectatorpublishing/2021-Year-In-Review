    "blurb": "In the past year, Spectator’s photo section has weathered many challenges. Taking photos of a campus that was missing the majority of its student population presented numerous difficulties, and our work was complicated by only having a handful of photographers in New York City. Despite these challenges, we pioneered new methods of capturing photos, participating in everything from socially distanced portrait sessions to Zoom and FaceTime photoshoots. We completed photo essays, captured events everywhere from Times Square to West Harlem, took portraits of campus leaders and students, and worked to ensure Spectator’s articles received suitable visual coverage. Here, you will find just a glimpse of our work, including our coverage of virtual theater performances, President Joe Biden’s election, and the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers’ strike.",

From this spawned long-form historical analysis, which relayed into the mixture of short-form, breaking news, and continuing long-form coverage of the most prominent happenings in Morningside Heights and West Harlem. City News coverage is not centered around what happens on campus, but in the community around us, especially the area that makes up Community Board 9, which is Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights. Our sourcing comes in part from speaking to Columbia faculty and admin when the stories call for it, but in large part we speak to Community Board members, community organizations, spokespersons for city offices, and residents via on the ground reporting. Our intended audience is meant to be residents of CB9, particularly those readers whose issues we seek to give a platform to through our coverage.",

While Columbia worked to increase COVID-19 safety on campus, many in the city found it difficult to access basic health resources in their own communities. There is a lack of access—not necessarily just to resources, although that is also an issue. However, City News has also been looking into the effects of environmental racism in the area as well as the growing movement for climate justice taking place in New York City, and thus West Harlem, as well. The Mailman School of Public Health has noted the effects of the climate crisis on working-class areas in New York City, specifically noting an increase in levels of asthma among residents in lower-income neighborhoods where air pollution is prevalent. The section’s coverage stands at the intersection of timely coverage of the lasting pandemic, as well as the ways environmental racism and other health concerns continually impact the community, and the steps residents are taking to counteract this.

Also, the University’s expansion and increased presence in West Harlem have also led to increasing prioritization of less affordable housing—which many local residents can’t afford. These actions have furthered the gentrification of West Harlem and put pressure on the community, calling into question Columbia’s role in the district. Even issues that don’t seem directly tied to the University—like rising rents, poor living conditions, and cruel landlording practices—can be compared to Columbia’s gentrification of the neighborhood.",

In January, the University was hit by an antitrust lawsuit that alleged it colluded with peer-institutions to decrease student financial aid. In March, a Columbia professor alleged that the data the University provides to the U.S. News ranking may be a misrepresentation. ",

During a year when remote learning and campus communities felt more disconnected than ever, our illustrators bridged that gap by visualizing the colors, themes, and imagery of personal experience and emotion. Whether we are covering the 2020 election, recounting details of a year on zoom, or simply finding the silver-linings of everyday life, we encourage you to think outside the box and reflect upon the past year — through our eyes.
